# DEMO BUILD

## Usage

To compile the demo build execute:

```shell
./compile.sh
```

This script will execute the following actions

1. Genrate a parser for each protocol description located in `GENERATOR/SCL5` and copy it to `src`
2. Generate the `Parser.cpp` interface to connect the stream segmenting and parsers. The parsing interface is generated from the config file located at `configs/CONFIG.sws`.
3. Perform a full clean make of the project

## CONFIG.sws

This config file has the following format:
```
[Protocol] ': [String_To_Match] {, [String_To_Match] } '> [B | L] '< [Skip_Bits] ?(-DEBUG) ';
```
* Protocol - The protocol you are adding
* String_To_Match - Strings the protocols contain
* B | L - Whether the protocol is (B)ig or (L)ittle Endian
* Skip_Bits - The number of bits between the end of the TCP header and start of the protocol payload
* -DEBUG - Optional flag to generate stats for the indicated protocol

An example of a config line for HTTP is below:
```
HTTP:HTTP/1.1,GET>B<0;
```

## Test Suite

The software package comes with a built in test suite to assess performance located in `../TEST`.
The test suite will evaluate TCPStream's ability to identify streams for any packet captures located in `../TEST/PCAP`. Run the test suite in the TEST directory with the command:
```shell
./ProcessStream.sh
```
The test suite will complete the following actions:
* Preprocess each input pcap in the PCAP directory to segment it into numbered streams, with the protocol identified using tshark (Wireshark command line)
* The preprocessed input will be output to `TEST/EXPECTED_RESULT` for manual inspection if desired
* Complete a full clean make of TCPStream, including generating the parsers and interface
* Process the same input pcaps through TCPStream using both *String Matching* and *SPID* seperately.
* The results of the runs will be output to `TEST/ACTUAL_RESULT/<Algorithm>` respectively.
* Perform analysis of the results and output the statistics to console.

## Notes

* You should not enter the GENERATOR folder for any reason unless you know what you are doing, it is entirely self contained

* Unused variable warnings have been suppressed in the project compilation to prevent spam from the generated parsers
