% This program walks through a SCL5 definition of a protocol with unique 
% naming in definitions and ensures that all references match and also
% uniquely names them

% The input to the program is a SCL5 file named "protocol"_declarations.scl5. 
% The input file is a SCL5 description of a protocol that has uniquely named
% definitions from the previous TXL script.

% The output of this program is a SCL5 file named "protocol"_UID.scl5.
% The output file is the input SCL5 file with unique naming of all references.
